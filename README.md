# ðŸŸ¢ Face Detection Pro

Welcome to Face Detection Pro, a real-time face detection system built for folks who love clean Python projects â€” no internet nonsense, no weird installs, no headaches. Just pure offline tech, structured properly, feature-packed, ready to flex your Python skills.

ðŸ’» What This Does:
âœ… Real-time face detection using your webcam or video files
âœ… Uses pure OpenCV â€” no dlib, no extra system installs needed
âœ… Fancy FPS counter to track performance
âœ… Snapshots of detected faces saved with timestamps
âœ… Sound alert when a face is spotted (toggleable)
âœ… Simple GUI window to control detection without touching terminal
âœ… Detection zone: Only detect faces inside the center of the frame (optional)
âœ… History logs of face counts saved when you quit
âœ… Fully offline â€” no internet, no API keys, no sneaky downloads

ðŸ“¦ Project Structure:

â”œâ”€â”€ main.py               # The main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ detector/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ face_detector.py  # Handles face detection logic (pure OpenCV)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ video_stream.py   # Video stream + GUI + detection
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logger.py         # Handles logging
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py         # Central config for colors/zones
â”œâ”€â”€ faces/                # Snapshots of detected faces saved here
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                 # System logs & detection history

ðŸš€ Quick Start:
Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Program

python main.py
Use the GUI to start detection, toggle sound, or quit anytime.

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
Python 3.7+

OpenCV

Numpy

(Already listed in requirements.txt for easy install)

ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists:
Because face detection projects don't have to be messy. This project started basic, but evolved into a maxed-out, modular, offline-friendly system â€” no internet, no complex setups, just clean code that works.

âœ¨ Credits:
Big shout to OpenCV and Python for making computer vision easy.

ðŸ¤˜ Final Note:
Use this responsibly. It's for personal projects, learning, or fun offline tools.
Enjoy the project â€” and welcome to the cool dev squad.
